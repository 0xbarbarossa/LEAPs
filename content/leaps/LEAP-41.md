## Simple Summary
This LEAP proposes to reduce incentives for GrantsDAO from $2500 / month paid in LYRA or USDC to $1000 / month. 

## Abstract
GrantsDAO to receive $1000 / month in LYRA or USDC. 

## Motivation
The current structure is too costly, with the July-Nov epoch costing the DAO 350,000 LYRA tokens (1,050,000 LYRA annually). Whilst the work of GrantsDAO is important, the current cost basis is excessive. 

## Rationale
The original justification for $2,500/month centered around matching the Lyra Council. However, the Lyra Council deals with fundamental and technical protocol governance issues. GrantsDAO, whilst important, has a lower technical barrier for Council Members and a different set of role requirements. This alone justifies a difference in compensation rates.  

## Specification 
From the beginning of the next epoch (March 2023), Lyra GrantsDAO members will receive the following each month: $1000 worth of LYRA, using the open price on coingecko on the first of each month. If this price is less than $0.05, the DAO may pay council members in USDC.
