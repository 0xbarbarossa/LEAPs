## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
The success of Lyra thus far has been in large part due to the vibrant Discord community and the early users and LPs of the protocol. This LEAP requests that the Council authorize up to 15,000,000 LYRA tokens (1.5% of total supply) to be distributed to community members and users of the Protocol, with a snapshot of relevant contributions to be taken at 11:00 UTC Time 25/11/2021. 

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the LEAP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the LEAP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
This LEAP proposes that the Council authorize the current core contributors to distribute up to 15,000,000 LYRA tokens to community members and early Lyra LPs and traders. These tokens will be distributed and made available on the 14th of December, along with the Ignition tokens. 
The details of the distribution will be left to the discretion of the core contributors. 

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the LEAP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the LEAP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the LEAP will address the issue!-->

Lyra's Ignition program has successfully driven usage and volume of the platform. For the Lyra DAO to succeed, however, governance tokens and decision making must be distributed to a large base of holders. These holders should ideally have a diverse set of skills and perspectives, including engaged active community members, traders and LPs alike. This LEAP will ensure that the core contributors can widely distribute the token to such community members, so that good governance can be achieved following December 14th.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the LEAP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
The Council will grant the Core Contributors - who are strictly ineligible for this distribution - to allocate tokens to Discord community members, and early Lyra traders and liquidity providers 
as they see fit. This should be based on a fair and logical framework, to be disclosed in full to the community by December 5th.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
The Council should not be able to determine this distribution, as some Council members are eligible for the distribution. Further, leaving the details of a distribution 
to be debated by the community presents a clear problem - community members have a clear incentive to lobby Council members to alter the distribution to benefit themselves. 
This presents an even larger challenge when considering the fact that we cannot verify that each account belongs to a unique individual. By delegating the distribution responsibility to the core contributors,
these issues are sidestepped.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Lyra currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
N/A 
### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for LEAPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
N/A
### Configurable Values
<!--Please list all values configurable under this implementation.-->
Maximum LYRA to be distributed by the Core Contributors in accordance with this LEAP = 15,000,000.
