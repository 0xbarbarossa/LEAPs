## Simple Summary
Contract with Noether Labs Pty Ltd, an Australian corporate entity, to perform functions related to the deployment and maintenance of a front-end for the protocol. 

## Abstract
Engage with a corporate entity to perform front-end related functions using developer tools and infrastructure.

## Motivation
There are a number of functions that would be beneficial to the DAO that currently require a centralized entity to execute. This includes, but is not limited to, maintaining and hosting an interface to the core protocol. This LEAP proposes contracting such an entity - Noether Labs Pty Ltd, for this function. 

## Specification
Noether Labs is requesting an initial funding amount to cover 6 months of operational costs. This amount is equal to $30,000 USD, as there are a number of subscription-based tools that require annual payment up-front (and no further payments for the rest of the year). In return, Noether Labs will deploy and maintain a front-end for the protocol for that period. 

All protocol-related functions will remain the domain of the DAO, this entity would solely exist to engage and interface with relevant parties in order to maintain and develop the user interface. Specifically, all actions and requirements to host https://github.com/lyra-finance/lyra-dapp. 

### Rationale
This LEAP formalizes the engagement between a service provider and the DAO, providing transparency and clarity to the community. Other service providers may also propose LEAPs for the Council to vote on, on behalf of the DAO.
